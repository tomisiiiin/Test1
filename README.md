# Project_Presentation Generator

Files added:
- generate_presentation.py  -- Python script that creates Project_Presentation.pptx
- slides_content.md         -- Slide content summary

How to generate the PowerPoint locally:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install python-pptx: pip install python-pptx
3. Run: python generate_presentation.py
4. The script will create Project_Presentation.pptx in the current directory.

Notes:
- I could not directly attach a binary .pptx in this chat. Running the script will produce an identical PowerPoint file ready to download from your environment.
- If you want, I can also open a pull request instead of committing directly.
